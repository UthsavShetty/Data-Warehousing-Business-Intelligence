### Observations in SOR
- Different unique key for product’s table across all SORs e.g. ProductID, BrandID, ProductLabel
- Length of the values were different across SORs
- Data type for dates in the CSV and TXT files are not constant.

### Data Profiling
- Changed the SOR Load and Update dates from TIMESTAMP to DATE for Oracle and PostgreSQL to load SOR_LOADDATE
- Converted data type values for DATES to DATE data type across all the CSVs and Text input files
- For SCDs DimProductPrice and DimProductCost we had to use SOR dimproduct (MySQL) as a bridge between input file price_cny_step_1_of_4   and DIMPRODUCT
- Converted all the possible columns in the target metadata from Big Decimal to INT
- Data Type csv contains all the column’s data type which we kept constant across all the SORs and Target table depending upon the
  size of data
- Had to append zeros and trimmed values in the for joining product tables

### Reject Codes and Error Handling
- Reject Codes are used to catch bad data,missing values or invalid data present in the facts rejects
- Reject Reasons help you understand the bad data in detail
- Handled null values using Relation.ISNULL function and applied code 99 if nulls are found
- Refer Error handling document for more details
